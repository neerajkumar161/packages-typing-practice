# DefinitelyTyped Typing Files for Popular Libraries [Practicing Repository only]

This repository contains DefinitelyTyped typing files for popular libraries, including `cors` and `node-cron`. The DefinitelyTyped project provides high-quality TypeScript type definitions for JavaScript libraries.

## Libraries Included

### 1. cors

The `cors` library provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware for Node.js. It allows you to enable CORS in your Node.js applications and define CORS policies for handling cross-origin requests.

The `node-cron` library is a flexible cron-like scheduler for Node.js. It allows you to schedule recurring tasks or cron jobs in your Node.js applications using a simple syntax.
